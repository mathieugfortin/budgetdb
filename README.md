I always find existing budget software lack at projecting to the future.  

If I can file most of my repetitive expenses, use lump sums for areas wher details are not available, there is no reason I can't have a pretty acurate view of my situation in  a year or two.

From there, if I change a few parameters, tweak my savings a bit, cut an expense, increase mortgage payment by 10%, I can see real results for the short and medium terms.

I used to have an excel sheet that did that pretty well but at over 12MB, debugging became a chore and it fell by the wayside.  This is an attempt at getting that back.



            elif !(event.budget_only is True and event.date_actual <= datetime.today()):

ToDo list:

Pay stubs with multiple transactions, related to each other
    deductions that stops after a maximum
    check taxes forms

***budget graphs ***
need bar chart with same data a pie chart
show/hide data based on slider movement

*** add a checkbox in the account list view if the balance is confirmed.  create an audit.
*** list view, sort asc, desc

Warning on dates that are repeat monthly and day is > 28
    move recurring events to the last day of the month in this case?

Dynamic Total on chart?  
a chart with a running total per account category would be nice.  cashflow, savings, mortgage...

Users, families, sharing

add different currencies

add to preferences how far in the future budgeted transactions will go

account categories don't have a way to be set in the app

budgeted events growth, % per month, % per year...

taxes datasheets.  per category, make recap sheets for income and deductions

show the budgeted events bitfields in the forms
