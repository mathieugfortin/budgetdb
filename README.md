I always find existing budget software lack at projecting to the future.  

If I can file most of my repetitive expenses, use lump sums for areas wher details are not available, there is no reason I can't have a pretty acurate view of my situation in  a year or two.

From there, if I change a few parameters, tweak my savings a bit, cut an expense, increase mortgage payment by 10%, I can see real results for the short and medium terms.

I used to have an excel sheet that did that pretty well but at over 12MB, debugging became a chore and it fell by the wayside.  This is an attempt at getting that back.




ToDo list:
Dynamic budgetedEvents are killing performance.  They should create unverified Transactions.  Handling of budgetedEvents change will be tricky
