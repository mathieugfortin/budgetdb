# Don't forget to filter out results depending on the visitor !

Take care to escape anything you put in HTML code to avoid XSS attacks when displaying data that may have been input by a user! format_html helps.

ToDo:
many cat1, cat2, views to finish
check if audit is the last event of the day...  order them so
TransactionListView uses calendars and it's slow, refactor like AccountperiodicView3 but for all accounts

When BE changes, delete linked unverified transaction and create new ones. May fuck up the date_planned.  
    Do I even need date_planned?  Yes, to avoid creating a transaction on a transaction that was moved.  
    I will probably need a form to correct the orphan ones.  yerk

Feels like I'm calculating balances at 4 different places.  Am I?  Can I pull all that in the model?

****chart has bad data if audit is not in the range  account view looks OK

Dynamic Total on chart?  
a chart with a running total per account category would be nice.  cashflow, savings, mortgage...
