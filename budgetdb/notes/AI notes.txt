To start a new session:
Project Context: I'm working on a Django project called budgetdb.

Tech Stack: Django 6.0, Bootstrap 5, Crispy Forms, and django-tables2. I'm using i18n_patterns with an en-ca prefix.

Key Architecture:

Namespace: My app uses app_name = 'budgetdb'.

Auth: I'm using the built-in django.contrib.auth.urls but overriding templates in templates/registration/.

Recent Progress: We just fixed the password reset flow and set up AJAX-dependent dropdowns for the StatementForm (filtering payment_transaction by account).

Current Task: [Describe what you want to work on next]
